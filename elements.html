									<h3>Industrial Experience</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/DBS.jpg.avif" alt="" /></span>At DBS, I played a key role in developing a Feature Mart, integrating daily financial, non-financial, and product summary data to 
																												ensure high granularity and accuracy for enhanced data accessibility and actionable insights. I also developed a classification model
																												for two interaction codes—term deposits and remittances (inward and outward)—leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to achieve 
																												high accuracy and reliability. Additionally, I built an automated campaign pipeline to deliver personalized nudges for product consumption,
																												usage, and retention, enabling data-driven marketing campaigns that significantly improved customer engagement and retention</p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/EY.jpg" alt="" /></span>At EY, I began working on demand forecasting for the Czech Republic market for Unilever,
																										the world’s largest FMCG company. It was a new domain for me, making the initial days challenging, but with guidance from a demand planner and my Coursera learning,
																										I quickly adapted. Due to my strong performance, I was promoted from Associate Consultant to Consultant within five months. <br />
																										I then transitioned to the UK market, one of the most complex markets we handled for Unilever. 
																										The project was in a difficult phase, with numerous unresolved tickets from demand planners. 
																										After addressing these issues, we proposed and developed UK Demand Forecasting Gen3, incorporating pricing and promotional features. 
																										I collaborated with PhDs and studied research papers to analyze pre- and post-promotion impacts and price inflation. 
																										After a year of rigorous research and development, UK Gen3 was successfully deployed in production.</p>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Mahindra.jpeg" alt="" /></span>At Mahindra, I worked on the WAP Project, which identified potential customers looking to exchange their vehicles. 
																										I developed and deployed models for nine commercial vehicles, collaborating with multiple teams to ensure that service managers
																										received pop-ups when entering a chassis number.<br />

																										I then transitioned to the Strategic Sourcing Unit, where I was initially tasked with understanding Profit & Loss (P&L)
																										and Balance Sheets (BS). To my surprise, I was assigned to Financial Forecasting, where we extracted BS and P&L data for 3,000+ 
																										suppliers and developed a scoreboard approach across 10 categories, including funding, liquidity, and profitability.
										
																										Simultaneously, I worked on multiple projects, including Commodity Forecasting for L1 and L2 materials to support price negotiations 
																										and assisted in developing several Qlik Sense dashboards.</p>
